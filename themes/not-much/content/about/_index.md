I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Applied Economics at the Department of Economic Policy. 
Before that, I held Assistant Professor (untenured) and postdoctoral positions at the Institute of Economics, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa. I earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Turin and Collegio Carlo Alberto, with prior master's degrees in Economics and Complexity (Collegio Carlo Alberto) and Theoretical Physics (University of Turin). 
During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting scholar at the Department of Network and Data Science, Central European University, Budapest.

My research focuses on understanding the drivers of `innovation` and `scientific discovery`. 
To achieve this, I combine econometric techniques, including causal inference, with advanced computational tools like natural language processing and network science. 
I analyze large datasets of patents and scientific papers to generate evidence-based insights that can inform the design of effective science and innovation funding policies.
